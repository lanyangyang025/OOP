Description :

This simple animate application can show different ball moving with different moving pattern in the center canvas.

There are 8 different strategies you can choose:

1) Straight: the ball will move straightly in the center canvas
2) Color: the ball will change its color randomly when moving
3) Breathing: the ball will change its radius when moving
4) Curve: the ball will change the turning direction when moving
5) Drunken: the ball will move randomly every 5 ticks as if it's drunken, but gradually move from upper left to bottom right
6) Swing: the ball will swing along one direction while move normally along the other direction
7) Wander: the ball will move completely randomly
8) Magic: the ball will move in a spiral route periodically and increase/decrease its speed


Operation steps[1]:
1) Type the name of a strategy into the text field on the left.  See the list below for the available strategies above .  
2) Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will then add it to both the drop lists.
3) "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy selected on the top drop list.
4) "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists. 
5) The new strategy is placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining. For instance, add then combine "Curve" and "Breathing" to make a ball that curves and breathes.
6) "Make Switcher" will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight.  
7) Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. 
8) Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
9) By clicking the "Clear All" button in the north panel, it will remove all the current balls from the main canvas.
