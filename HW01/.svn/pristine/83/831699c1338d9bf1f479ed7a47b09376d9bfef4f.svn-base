The fields we choose in class "AShape" are x-coordinate, y-coordinate of the shape center, width of the shape, height of the shape and the shape's color, which we think are essential to represent a shape. The variable names are shown in the following:
x_position: Interger type, represent the x-coordinate of the shape center
y_position: Interger type, represent the y-coordinate of the shape center
color: Color type, represent the color of the shape
width: Integer type, represent the width of the shape
