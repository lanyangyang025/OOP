In this app, you will see a text field, a 'Add to list' button on the left, a 'Combine' button, 
two combo boxes, a 'Make Selected Ball' button, a 'Make Switcher' button, a'Switch!' button on the middle,
and a 'CLear All' button on the GUI initially.

If you want to add a specific strategy, you need to type your class name on the text field. For example, 
you need to type 'ballworld.StraightBall' on the text field to make a straight ball on the panel. 

There are five kinds of strategy(The content in the brace is the abbreviation of each strategy):
Breathing Strategy(Breathing): the radius is changing with time.
ColorChanging Strategy(ColorChanging): the color is changing with time.
Curve Strategy(Curve): the trace of the ball is a curve.
Wander Strategy(Wander): the ball moves in a random trace.
Drunken Strategy(Drunken): the ball moves in a random trace.

The strategies will show on the two combo boxes.

When you press the 'Make Selected Ball' button, the screen will show the ball with the strategy of the 
first combo box.

You could combine the strategy of the first combo box and the second combo box and the new strategy will
be shown on the first combo box.

The 'Make Switcher' would let you add a switch ball with the strategy. When you press the 'Switch!' button,
the switch balls would be changed to the strategy of the first combo box.

The label will show the Ball numbers on the screen.

If you want to clear the panel, you could press 'Clear' button. All the balls on the panel will be deleted 
and the count will show 0 on the label.
