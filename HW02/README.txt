In this app, you will see a text field, a 'make ball' button, a 'clear' button and a text label on the GUI initially.

If you want to add a specific ball, you need to type your class name on the text field. For example, you need to type 'ballworld.StraightBall' on the text field to make a straight ball on the panel. 

There are five kinds of ball:
breathing ball(ballworld.BreathingBall): the radius is changing with time.
colorChanging ball(ballworld.ColorChangingBall): the color is changing with time.
curve ball(ballworld.CurveBall): the trace of the ball is a curve.
straight ball(ballworld.StraightBall): the ball moves straightly.
wander ball(ballworld.WanderBall): the ball moves in a random trace.

The label will show the count of balls on the panel.

If you want to clear the panel, you could press 'Clear' button. All the balls on the panel will be deleted and the count will show 0 on the label.
