Description :

This simple animate application can show different ball moving with different moving pattern in the center canvas.

There are 9 different strategies you can choose:

1) Straight: the ball will move straightly in the center canvas
2) Color: the ball will change its color randomly when moving
3) Breathing: the ball will change its radius when moving
4) Curve: the ball will change the turning direction when moving
5) Drunken: the ball will move randomly every 5 ticks as if it's drunken, but gradually move from upper left to bottom right
6) Swing: the ball will swing along one direction while move normally along the other direction
7) Wander: the ball will move completely randomly
8) Magic: the ball will move in a spiral route periodically and increase/decrease its speed
9) Collide: the balls will collide if they overlap
There are 3 different interaction strategies you can choose:

i. Interaction criteria is that the balls must have collided, i.e. are overlapping.
1) Split(must combine with the collide strategy): the ball will split a ball that collides with it into two sub balls, each sub ball has the half radius of the original ball. If the radius of sub ball is smaller than 1, it will be vanished. 
ii. Interaction critera is something other than having collided. 
2) Freeze(You can run it without combining with the collide strategy): the ball will create a freeze area to slow down all the balls within its area. Once the freezing ball gets out of the freeze area, its speed will be restored.
3) Protector(You can run it without combining with the collide strategy): the ball will create a protector to protect itself. The protector will protect the ball from splitting and hitting.

There are 10 different paint strategies you can choose:

1) Ball: the ball shape will be painted in the center canvas
2) BirdSheepImage: either a bird image or a sheep image will be painted in the center canvas. Each of them has 50% to be painted.
3) Ellipse: the ellipse shape will be painted in the center canvas
4) Fish1: the fish shape with no opening mouth will be painted in the center canvas
5) Fish2: the fish shape with the opening mouth will be painted in the center canvas
6) Mario: the Mario Image will be painted in the center canvas and it moves towards the right part of the canvas
7) NiceFish: the fish shape with a black eye will be painted in the center canvas and it moves towards the right part of the canvas
8) Rectangle: the rectangle shape will be painted in the center canvas
9) Square: the square shape will be painted in the center canvas(Non-affine transform-based paint strategy)
9) SwimFish: the animated fish will be painted in the center canvas


Operation steps[1]:
1) Type the name of a strategy into the text field on the left.  See the list below for the available strategies above .  
2) Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will then add it to both the drop lists.
3) Type the name of a paint strategy into the text field on the right.  See the list below for the available paint strategies above .  
4) Clicking the "Add" button will then add it to both the drop lists.
5) "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy and the paint strategy selected on two drop lists.
6) "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists. 
7) The new strategy is placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining. For instance, add then combine "Curve" and "Breathing" to make a ball that curves and breathes.
8) "Make Switcher" will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight with the selected paint strategy.  
9) Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. 
10) Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
11) By clicking the "Clear All" button in the north panel, it will remove all the current balls from the main canvas.
