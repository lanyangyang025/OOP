To run the project correctly, the user needs to follow the three steps first:

1) run EngineControl.java file
2) run ClientControl.java file, the content on the text area of Remote Host is the ip address of local host.
3) You could put the remote host address on the text area of Remote Host, and then press the "connect" button. The Engine
   GUI would show the message "Hello from the client!" and the Client GUI would show the message "Connection to (your IP address) 
   established!" if the connection establishes successfully.

If the connection could be set up correctly, we could do the following commands.

* In Client GUI, we could write down the string in "Send msg to remot..." area and press "Enter" to send the message to the server.
* In Engine GUI, we could write down the string in "Send msg to remote client's view" area and press "Enter" to send the message to 
  the client.
* In Client GUI, we could run different tasks based on the parameter(array) in "Run Parameter" area. There are three tasks provided:
  util.GetSum: get sum of the array
  util.GetLargestNumber: get the maximum of the array
  util.GetReverseString: reverse the string
  The example of the array: 1,2,3,4,5
  We need to write the task on the text area above the button "Add to lists", and then press the "Add to lists" button, the tasks 
  will be included in both two JComboBox. We choose one task on the top JComboBox, and press "Run tasks", the task will be performed 
  and the result of the task will be shown on both the server GUI and client GUI.
* We can combine two tasks in the two JComboBox as well and the new task will be added in the two JComboBoxes.
